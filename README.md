# Gameofpapers 
## Description
This is the frontend side of our Machine Learning project called the Game of Papers. This project recommends papers based on our recommender BERT model. The frontend is developed using Angular. Angular is a popular open-source framework for building web applications. It is maintained by Google and is widely used for frontend development due to its many advantages like Cross-platform development, Component-based architecture, Data binding, Dependency Injection, Performance. More information can be found here https://angular.io/. 

One of our dependecies is Ag-Grid, a popular library that provides a powerful grid system for displaying and manipulating large amounts of data in web applications. It is designed to be highly customizable and scalable, with features like column sorting, filtering, grouping, and pagination. More information about that can be found here https://www.ag-grid.com/.

## Steps to run this code

### Step 1:
Clone this GitHub repository

### Step 2:
Install NodeJS, 
We developed using the version v18.16.0 (Latest LTS supported by angular)

### Step 3:
Install Node Package Manage (NPM), 
We developed using the version 8.19.4

### Step 4:
Install Angular CLI, 
We developed using the version Angular CLI: 13.2.6

```
npm install -g @angular/cli@13.2.6
```

### Step 5:
Move inside the project root directory and run the following command:
```
npm install
```
This command installs all the dependencies listed in the package.json file, including AG-Grid, and other required libraries.

### Step 6:
Run ng serve to start the development server:
```
ng serve
```
This command starts the development server and compiles the code. Once the compilation is complete, you should see a message similar to this:

```
** Angular Live Development Server is listening on localhost:4200, open your browser on http://localhost:4200/ **
: Compiled successfully.
```

### Step 7:
Open your browser and navigate to ``` http://localhost:4200 ``` to view the application.
